    <h2>Help information</h2>

    The work of the pshash pseudo-hash function is pictured like that:

    <p>
    <IMG SRC="../../documentation/figures/hash.svg" ALIGN=top WIDTH=650>
    </p>

    <p>Here, every set of same-colored circles represents a <em>source</em>, i.e. an array of characters. A <em>source configuration</em> is an array of sources paired with the amounts of symbols to be picked from each source. For example, here the function will pick two circles from the red source and four circles from the green source.</p>

    <p>The first stage is the Merge-Choice stage (MC), which takes a source configuration L and a key k<sub>1</sub> (the private choice key), picking the given amounts of elements from the sources and then shuffling them all together. The second, Shuffle stage takes the resulting list of elements and a second key k<sub>2</sub> (the private shuffle key), performing a second shuffle on the list. This is done to ensure that multiple pairs of keys return the same final pseudo-hash, and thus the user's particular pair is impossible to guess.</p>

    <p>
    The pshash function accepts the following inputs:
    <ul>
        <li>
            A source configuration keyword, which can be one of the following:

            <ul>
                <li> <em>long</em> (8 upper case, 8 lower case, 5 special characters, 4 digits). This is the default configuration. </li>
                <li> <em>medium</em> (5 symbols of each type) </li>
                <li> <em>short</em> (4 symbols of each type) </li>
                <li> <em>anlong</em> (7 upper case, 7 lower case, 7 digits) </li>
                <li> <em>anshort</em> (4 upper case, 4 lower case, 4 digits) </li>
                <li> <em>pin</em> (4-digit pin code) </li>
                <li> <em>mediumpin</em> (6-digit pin code) </li>
                <li> <em>longpin</em> (8-digit pin code) </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            A public key, i.e. a string of characters representing the website or service that requires the password.
            Examples include "google", "steam", "spotify", etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            A private <em>choice</em> key, a number between 0 and 10^42 (upper bound may depend on the source configuration).
        </li>
        <li>
            A private <em>shuffle</em> key, a number between 0 and 10^25 (upper bound may depend on the source configuration).
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
